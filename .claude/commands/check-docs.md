# MCP DOCUMENTATION UPDATE CHECK

Systematic review protocol for README.md and module-level DOCS.md updates following CLAUDE.md MCP server standards.

**Execute this command manually after making code changes to determine if documentation updates are required.**

---

## CRITICAL RULE

**WHEN IN DOUBT, ASK THE USER.**

If you are uncertain whether README.md or DOCS.md should be updated or not, ALWAYS ask the user before making the decision.

---

## OVERVIEW

Documentation updates are OPTIONAL - only required when changes affect the documented contract or tool behavior.

**Two separate concerns:**
- **README.md:** Usage focused (How to INSTALL and USE the MCP server)
- **src/domain/DOCS.md:** Architecture focused (How modules in that domain WORK internally)

---

## README.md CHECK

**Purpose:** README documents installation, quick start, environment variables, and tool usage.

### Update Required When:

1. **New tool added to server.py**
   - New @mcp.tool definition
   - New use case for the MCP server

2. **Tool parameters change**
   - New parameter added to existing tool
   - Parameter removed or renamed
   - Default values change

3. **Tool behavior changes**
   - Output format changes
   - New fields in response
   - Different use case guidance in docstring

4. **Environment variables change**
   - New API keys or tokens required
   - .env structure changes
   - .mcp.json env section changes

5. **Installation or setup changes**
   - New dependencies required
   - venv setup changes
   - .mcp.json path changes

### Update NOT Required When:

- Bug fixes in src/ module implementation
- Internal refactoring of workflow functions
- Performance improvements (caching, pagination)
- Code reorganization without changing tool interface
- Function renaming within src/ modules

### Decision Workflow:

1. **Read README** - Check tool descriptions and setup instructions
2. **Identify Impact** - Does user-visible interface change?
3. **Decision:**
   - If tool interface/setup changes then Update README
   - If only internal implementation changes then Document reason for skipping
   - **If uncertain then ASK THE USER**

---

## MODULE DOCS.md CHECK

**Purpose:** Each domain folder in src/ has its own DOCS.md documenting its modules.

**Location:** src/domain_name/DOCS.md

### Update Required When:

1. **New tool module added to domain folder**
   - Add new ## module.py section to that domain's DOCS.md
   - Document workflow and functions

2. **New function added to existing module**
   - Add ### function_name() section
   - Describe WHAT the function does

3. **Function responsibility (WHAT) changes**
   - Function now does something different
   - Function purpose changes

4. **Input/Output contract changes**
   - Function parameters change
   - Return structure changes
   - Error handling behavior changes

5. **Orchestrator call sequence changes**
   - Functions called in different order
   - New functions added to workflow
   - Functions removed from sequence

6. **New domain folder created**
   - Create new DOCS.md in that folder
   - Document all modules in the domain

### Update NOT Required When:

- Bug fixes in function implementation (HOW)
- Internal refactoring within function body
- Performance improvements
- Code reorganization without changing responsibilities
- Variable renaming (internal only)
- Algorithm changes that don't affect contract

### Decision Workflow:

1. **Identify affected domain** - Which src/domain/ folder contains changes?
2. **Read domain DOCS.md** - Locate sections describing changed modules/functions
3. **Identify Impact** - Does the WHAT change, or only the HOW?
4. **Check call sequence** - Did workflow orchestrator order change?
5. **Decision:**
   - If WHAT changed then Update domain's DOCS.md section
   - If only HOW changed then Document reason for skipping
   - **If uncertain then ASK THE USER**

---

## TEST SUITE DOCUMENTATION CHECK

**Purpose:** Test suite documentation describes test domains, validation workflow, and quality monitoring procedures.

**Location:** debug/scraping_suite/README.md

### Update Required When:

1. **New test domain added**
   - New URL added to domains.txt
   - New domain folder appears in baselines/
   - Domain represents new content type or technical challenge

2. **Test workflow changes**
   - run_baseline.py execution steps modified
   - compare_iterations.py analysis logic changed
   - New validation procedures added
   - Workflow phases reordered

3. **Test scripts modified**
   - run_baseline.py parameter changes
   - compare_iterations.py output format changes
   - New test scripts added to suite

4. **Output structure changes**
   - Baselines directory organization modified
   - Reports directory structure changed
   - Metadata JSON format altered
   - Iteration numbering scheme changed

### Update NOT Required When:

- Bug fixes in test scripts (internal logic)
- Internal refactoring of test functions
- Performance improvements to test execution
- Code reorganization without workflow changes
- Comment updates or formatting changes

### Decision Workflow:

1. **Identify Test Suite Changes** - Were files in debug/scraping_suite/ modified?
2. **Read Suite README** - Check documented workflow and structure
3. **Identify Impact** - Does change affect documented behavior or output?
4. **Decision:**
   - If test workflow/structure changes then Update suite README
   - If only internal implementation changes then Document reason for skipping
   - **If uncertain then ASK THE USER**

### Sections to Update:

**Test Domains Section:**
- Update when new domain added
- Include URL, content type description, technical challenges tested

**Usage Section:**
- Update when command-line usage changes
- Update when new scripts added

**Workflow Section:**
- Update when execution steps change
- Update when decision gates modified

**Output Structure Section:**
- Update when directory structure changes
- Update when file formats change

---

## COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Analyze Changes
List all files modified and nature of changes:
- Which files changed? (server.py, src/*.py, .mcp.json, .env)
- What changed in each file?
- Are changes to tool interface or internal implementation?

### Step 2: README Impact Assessment
Ask these questions:
1. Were new tools added to server.py?
2. Did tool parameters change (Annotated + Field)?
3. Did tool docstrings change (use cases)?
4. Did environment variables or setup change?
5. Did .mcp.json configuration change?

**If YES to any then README update likely required**

### Step 3: Module DOCS Impact Assessment
Ask these questions:
1. Were new modules added to a domain folder in src/?
2. Were new functions added to existing modules?
3. Do existing functions do something different (WHAT not HOW)?
4. Did function signatures change (parameters, return types)?
5. Did the workflow orchestrator call sequence change?
6. Was a new domain folder created in src/?

**If YES to any then that domain's DOCS.md update likely required**

### Step 3.5: Test Suite DOCS Impact Assessment
Ask these questions:
1. Were files in debug/scraping_suite/ modified?
2. Was a new test domain added to domains.txt?
3. Did test workflow execution steps change?
4. Did test output structure change (baselines/, reports/)?
5. Were new test scripts added?

**If YES to any then debug/scraping_suite/README.md update likely required**

### Step 4: Document Decisions
For each file (README, domain DOCS, test suite README), document:
```
FILE: README.md / src/domain/DOCS.md / debug/scraping_suite/README.md
CHANGE: <brief description>
SECTION: <which section would be affected>
DECISION: UPDATE REQUIRED / NO UPDATE / UNCERTAIN
REASON: <why WHAT changed or why only HOW changed>
ACTION: <if update required, what to update>
RECOMMENDATION: <formulate question + YES/NO recommendation for user>
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- If DECISION is UNCERTAIN then Ask the user with your recommendation
- If DECISION is UPDATE REQUIRED then Present recommendation to user for confirmation
- If DECISION is NO UPDATE then Present recommendation to user for confirmation

---

## RECOMMENDATION FORMAT

**CRITICAL:** Present a single, consolidated recommendation.

After completing Step 4, summarize:

```
OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:
- README.md: UPDATE / NO UPDATE
- src/domain/DOCS.md: UPDATE / NO UPDATE (list each affected domain)
- debug/scraping_suite/README.md: UPDATE / NO UPDATE

QUESTION (if applicable): [Specific uncertainty]
RECOMMENDATION: [e.g., "Update src/scraper/DOCS.md yes, README no, test suite README no"]
REASONING: [Brief explanation]
```

**Rules:**
1. One consolidated overview, not per-change
2. Only formulate question if uncertain
3. User makes final decision
