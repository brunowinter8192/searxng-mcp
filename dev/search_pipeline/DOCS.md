# dev/search_pipeline/

## Role

Production-mode smoke test suite for all 9 active search engines. Each per-engine smoke invokes the production engine class from `src/search/engines/` directly — no standalone pydoll setup, rate-limiter active, selectors and config internal to the engine class. Multi-engine smoke (`05`) fans out across all engines in parallel via `asyncio.gather`. `config.yml` retained for run parameters used by `02_burst_smoke.py` only.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.yml` | Run params (`queries_file`, `page_load_timeout`, `consent_settle`) and report path (`output_dir`) — used by `02_burst_smoke.py` only |
| `queries.txt` | 30 baseline queries (Tech 8 + Science 6 + German 6 + Niche 5 + Broad 5) |
| `01_google_smoke.py` | Google production-mode smoke — imports `GoogleEngine` from `src/`, calls `.search()` per query, rate-limiter active (4 req/60s), writes `google_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status: OK / EMPTY / ERROR |
| `02_burst_smoke.py` | Burst smoke against the production CLI — invokes `searxng-cli search_batch` per batch (one subprocess per N queries, warm Chrome amortized) and writes `burst_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Exists to validate the prod CLI path under the architectural rate pattern (4 queries per burst, optional cooldown). CLI flags: `--queries-per-burst N` (default 4), `--cooldown S` (default 60), `--max-queries N` (default all from queries.txt). |
| `04_ddg_smoke.py` | DuckDuckGo production-mode smoke — imports `DuckDuckGoEngine` from `src/`, calls `.search()` per query, rate-limiter active (4 req/60s), writes `ddg_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status: OK / EMPTY / ERROR |
| `05_search_smoke.py` | Multi-engine comparison smoke — imports all 8 engine classes from `src/`, fans out per-engine in parallel via `asyncio.gather`, merges by URL preserving per-engine snippets, fetches previews via `src/search/preview.py`, writes `search_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. CLI flags: `--engines` (default: google duckduckgo), `--max-queries N`. |
| `06_mojeek_smoke.py` | Mojeek production-mode smoke — imports `MojeekEngine` from `src/`, calls `.search()` per query, rate-limiter active (4 req/60s), writes `mojeek_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status: OK / EMPTY / ERROR |
| `07_lobsters_smoke.py` | Lobsters production-mode smoke — imports `LobstersEngine` from `src/`, calls `.search()` per query, rate-limiter active (4 req/60s), writes `lobsters_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status: OK / EMPTY / ERROR |
| `08_scholar_smoke.py` | Google Scholar smoke runner — imports `ScholarEngine` from `src/`, calls `.search()` directly (pydoll browser managed by `src/search/browser.py` singleton), runs 30 baseline queries. Rate limiter is engine-internal (4 req/60s → ~7.5 min total). Writes `scholar_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status taxonomy: OK (≥3 results) / EMPTY / SUSPECT / ERROR. |
| `09_openalex_smoke.py` | OpenAlex smoke runner — imports `OpenAlexEngine` from `src/`, calls `.search()` directly (pure HTTP, no browser), runs 30 baseline queries. Writes `openalex_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status taxonomy: OK / EMPTY / RATE_LIMITED / ERROR. OPENALEX_MAILTO env var forwarded automatically via engine. |
| `10_stack_exchange_smoke.py` | Stack Exchange smoke runner — imports `StackExchangeEngine` from `src/`, calls `.search()` directly (pure HTTP, no browser), runs 30 baseline queries against `api.stackexchange.com/2.3/search/advanced?site=stackoverflow`. Writes `se_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status taxonomy: OK / EMPTY / RATE_LIMITED / ERROR. Set `STACK_EXCHANGE_API_KEY` env var for 10k/day quota (without key: anonymous 300/day). |
| `11_pipeline_smoke.py` | Full-pipeline smoke — calls `search_web_workflow(query, _with_timings=True, engine_timeout=N)` per query (vs 05's per-engine fanout that bypasses `_merge_and_rank`), reads cache after each call. Per-URL block in MD output: title + URL + engines list + `source: SOURCE \| display: '...'` (chosen snippet) + `og: ... \| meta: ...` + per-engine snippet lines — singular baseline format that downstream investigation scripts (snippet_quality_analysis) parse without re-running queries. Per-query timing line + `Slot fill: GENERAL X/12, ACADEMIC Y/6, QA Z/2` (no OVERFLOW post-dl9-v3). Per-engine status/timing inline (`Engines: google=OK/200ms ddg=TIMEOUT/8002ms ...`) plus `Per-Engine Status Aggregate` section at end (OK/EMPTY/TIMEOUT/ERROR counts per engine across all queries). Writes `pipeline_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. CLI flags: `--max-queries N`, `--language` (default `en`), `--engine-timeout N` (float seconds, default None — pass 8.0 to enable per-engine watchdog around actual search work, with rate-limiter wait happening outside the watchdog). Use this script when reviewing the production ranking output as the user would see it AND when needing the structured baseline for downstream investigations. |
| `empty_classify_se.py` | Classification probe for Stack Exchange EMPTY queries — direct httpx against api.stackexchange.com (no rate limiter, no API key) for the 15 SE-EMPTY queries from the canonical 2026-05-04 multi-engine smoke. Two probes per query: `site=stackoverflow` (production-identical) + `site=stackexchange` (cross-site fallback for ENGINE_NICHE detection). Output `empty_classify_se_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status taxonomy: ENGINE_EMPTY / ENGINE_NICHE / RATE_LIMITED / PIPELINE_BUG / UNKNOWN. |
| `empty_classify_lobsters.py` | Classification probe for Lobsters EMPTY queries — pydoll browser with 3s wait (vs production 600ms) for the 11 Lobsters-EMPTY queries from the same smoke. Captures story count, page title, HTML snippet, plus screenshots for first 3 queries (`empty_classify_lobsters_screenshots/`). Output `empty_classify_lobsters_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status taxonomy: ENGINE_EMPTY / PIPELINE_BUG / BOT_BLOCK / UNKNOWN. |
| `12_max_results_probe.py` | Per-engine single-call ceiling probe — direct engine instantiation, one call per representative query at high `max_results` (Google/Scholar/SE 100, others 200), observes actual returned count + latency + status. Output `max_results_probe_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Used to diagnose effective per-engine pool depth before changing production max_results. |
| `google_selector_probe.py` | Google DOM-selector diagnostic — loads one query at `num=100`, counts production selector `#rso h3` matches vs `div.MjjYud` containers vs alternative selectors in the rendered DOM. Output `google_selector_probe_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Distinguishes selector limitations from server-side rendering caps. |
| `ddg_mojeek_selector_probe.py` | DDG + Mojeek selector coverage probe — per engine loads one query, counts production-selector matches vs alternative containers in DOM, tallies external links. Output `ddg_mojeek_selector_probe_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Confirms whether production selectors achieve 100% coverage of rendered results vs being structurally capped by page layout. |
| `13_free_word_probe.py` | Free-word query injection probe — appends 'pdf' or 'book' (no operator, just free word) to query string and measures domain-distribution shift across all 8 engines. 3 representative queries × 3 variants (baseline/+pdf/+book) = 9 runs. Output `free_word_injection_probe_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/` with per-variant URL listings + PDF-relevant / book-domain count comparison + new-domains delta. Validates free-word-as-relevance-bias hypothesis before designing filter flags. |
| `13_timing_ablation.py` | Timing-config ablation probe — A vs B comparison (status-quo vs aggressive Scholar polling/consent sleep/HTTP rate-limit) using concurrent fan-out across all 8 engines per query. 3 queries × 2 configs, 2-min cooldown between configs to reset rate-limiter buckets. Output `timing_ablation_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/` with per-engine latency Δ and Jaccard URL-set similarity. Used to validate timing-config migrations are result-equivalent before touching production. |
| `14_download_classify_probe.py` | Download-classify probe — sniff-classifies academic URLs from the search pool without saving content. Reads pipeline_smoke + free_word_injection_probe URLs, applies Tier-1 transforms (arxiv/aclanthology/openreview), GETs each URL with per-Tier timeout (T1=15s, others=8s), classifies outcome (PDF_OK / HTML_OK / HTML_HAS_PDF_LINK / HTML_PAYWALL / HTTP_4xx etc.). doi.org sampled to 300 (seed=42) for tractable runtime. Output `download_classify_<ts>.md` + `pool_<ts>.txt` + `pool_doi_sample_<ts>.txt` to `01_reports/`. Validates which domains deliver PDFs via direct GET vs. need Multi-Step extraction. |
| `15_citation_pdf_followup.py` | Two-hop citation_pdf_url validation — loads the HTML_HAS_PDF_LINK URLs from probe 14's report, GETs each (Hop 1 to extract citation_pdf_url meta), then GETs the extracted PDF URL (Hop 2). Per-domain semaphore keyed on PDF-host domain. Output `citation_pdf_followup_<ts>.md` with per-source-domain and per-PDF-host-domain success rates. Used to measure Multi-Step pipeline downloadability before migrating to src/. |
| `16_search_to_pdf_probe.py` | End-to-end search-to-PDF chain probe. Takes queries via CLI, runs `search_web_workflow` directly, applies the full chain (Tier-1 transform / DIRECT .pdf / MULTI_STEP citation_pdf_url / BLACKLIST), saves real PDFs to `~/Downloads/`. Per-query report with chain-path distribution + downloaded files. Imports chain logic from `src/scraper/pdf_chain.py` post-migration. CLI flags: `--top-n N`, queries as positional args. Used as regression check after pdf_chain refactors. |
| `18_uniform_timing_probe.py` | Uniform timing data collection — runs all 8 engines × 12 queries with monkey-patch instrumentation to capture per-engine page_load_ms / polling_cycles_used / http_request_ms / consent_fired / engine_search_total_ms plus preview URL fetch ms. Output `uniform_timing_probe_<ts>.md` with per-engine stats tables (min/mean/p50/p95/max), cross-engine maximum table (lock-in recommendations per dimension), per-query breakdown. Used to derive the uniform 3.6s lock-in values for src/search/ timeouts (max-observed = the value, no multiplier). |
| `19_books_probe.py` | Empirical book-domain inventory — appends free word `book` to 12 thematically broad queries (tech classics, fiction, subject areas, DE queries) and runs them against Google, DDG, Mojeek (3 browser engines, max 100/200/200). No classification applied — raw domain pool observation. Output `books_probe_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/` with: per-query URL listings, global domain frequency table (count ≥ 2), top-30 inspection table (domain + 3 sample paths), per-engine top-15 distribution, run stats. Informs BOOK_WHITELIST/BLACKLIST design for the `--books` CLI flag (bead searxng-gpk). |
| `21_semscholar_smoke.py` | Semantic Scholar production-mode smoke — imports `SemanticScholarEngine` from `src/`, calls `.search()` per query (pydoll browser, rate-limiter registered but acquire() in workflow not here), runs 30 baseline queries. Writes `semscholar_smoke_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. Status taxonomy: OK (≥3 results) / SUSPECT (1-2) / EMPTY / ERROR. Baseline 2026-05-07: 21/30 OK — EMPTY on dev-ops/consumer queries (expected, academic index) + burst-rate tail (queries 27-30 from no-throttle burst; production 4 req/min avoids). |
| `20_docs_probe.py` | Empirical docs-domain probe — appends free word `documentation` to 12 broad tech queries and runs them against Google, DDG, Mojeek (max 100/200/200). Evaluates H1-H13 heuristics (docs subdomain, readthedocs, gitbook, notion, developer-subdomain, /docs/, /documentation/, /reference/, /guide/, /api/, /tutorial/, /manual/, /learn/) against the URL pool. Output `docs_probe_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/` with: per-query URL listings, global domain frequency (count ≥ 2), heuristic coverage matrix (per-heuristic count + % + per-engine breakdown), top-30 inspection table (domain + H-codes + 3 sample paths), miss-set analysis (domains count ≥ 2 matching no heuristic — new-heuristic candidates), per-engine top-15 distribution, run stats. Informs `--docs` whitelist/heuristic design (bead searxng-x4f). |
| `inspect_query_log.py` | Quick summary of `src/logs/query_log.jsonl` — total record count, wall_ms min/mean/max, bottleneck-engine and TIMEOUT-hit counts, full per-engine breakdown of the most recent query (rate_wait_ms / search_ms / status / drop_reason / preview stats). CLI flag: `--tail N` to inspect the last N records. Used for spot-checking real query performance after the search_web_workflow logger went live. |
| `_lib/` | Shared parser + text utilities — single source of truth for `KNOWN_ENGINES`, `parse_smoke_report`, `strip_bloat`, `lexical_density`, `detect_bloat`; consumed by `snippet_quality_analysis.py`, `engine_distribution_analysis.py`, `snippet_selection_simulator.py`. |
| `snippet_quality_analysis.py` | Per-source bloat + lexical-density analysis over the singular pipeline_smoke baseline (auto-finds newest `pipeline_smoke_*.md` via glob+sort, no hardcoded filename). 11 sources (8 engines + scholar_strip derived bucket + og + meta), 9 bloat-pattern regexes (URL breadcrumb, Read-more, Web-results prefix, Featured-snippet prefix, social-proof, Scholar ellipsis, Mojeek nav-dump, HTML entities, Tag noise) + 1 JATS-XML pattern. Output sections: (1) per-source aggregated stats table (mean_clean_len, lex_density, % bloated, usefulness), (2) 8×8 engine-overlap matrix, (3) all-URLs side-by-side per-URL block with ⭐-Winner annotation per URL, (4) `Best by usefulness` aggregate (which source wins most often per length×density score across all URLs), (5) per-class breakdown of best-by-usefulness (GENERAL / ACADEMIC / QA winners). EN+DE combined stopword list for lexical_density (avoids penalizing German queries). Output `snippet_quality_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. |
| `engine_distribution_analysis.py` | Per-engine slot-count and slot-share analysis over the singular pipeline_smoke baseline (auto-finds newest `pipeline_smoke_*.md` via glob+sort). Imports `parse_smoke_report` from `snippet_quality_analysis.py`. Output sections: (1) slot-count total per engine (Total / GENERAL / ACADEMIC / QA / Solo / Overlap columns; column-sum footer shows actual vs URL-count baseline), (2) Per-Engine Status Aggregate quoted through from smoke tail (OK / EMPTY / TIMEOUT / ERROR), (3) slot-share + two baselines per engine within class — uniform (1/N) and OK-adjusted (engine OK / class OK sum) — with signed Δ columns; three sub-tables GENERAL / ACADEMIC / QA, (4) per-query distribution matrix (30 rows × 8 engine columns, cell = slot-count contributed by that engine in that query). Output `engine_distribution_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. |
| `snippet_selection_simulator.py` | Dry-run of new snippet-selection logic over the pipeline_smoke baseline (auto-finds newest `pipeline_smoke_*.md`). Imports `parse_smoke_report`, `strip_bloat`, `lexical_density` from `snippet_quality_analysis.py`. Selection: for each URL gather all non-empty sources (og, meta, per-engine snippets), score each as `clean_len × lex_density`, pick highest; if all sources below MIN_FLOOR=40 chars use best-of-worst fallback. Output sections: (1) Summary — analyzed/no-content/floor-trigger counts, NEW source distribution table, per-class NEW source distribution table, (2) Per-Query Picks — all 30 queries × all URLs, showing picked source, score, clean_len, ⚠ floor-trigger tag, and first 200 chars of picked snippet, (3) Floor-Triggered Cases — list of URLs where all sources were below MIN_FLOOR. Output `snippet_selection_<ts>.md` to `01_reports/`. |
| `01_reports/` | Singular baseline + investigation evidence: `pipeline_smoke_<ts>.md` (the canonical baseline produced by `11_pipeline_smoke.py`, contains all 600 URLs with per-source snippets — input for all investigation scripts), `snippet_quality_<ts>.md` (analysis output of `snippet_quality_analysis.py`), `empty_classify_se_<ts>.md` + `empty_classify_lobsters_<ts>.md` + `empty_classify_lobsters_screenshots/` (forensic probes from 2026-05-04 retained as historical evidence). Per-engine standalone smoke reports (`google_smoke_*.md` etc.) are NOT retained on dev — those scripts (`01_google_smoke.py` etc.) still exist for ad-hoc per-engine debugging but their outputs are gitignored / cleaned up. |

| Google | 30 | 0 | 0 | Uniform 4 req/min, no backoff on EMPTY |
| DuckDuckGo | 30 | 0 | 0 | Uniform 4 req/min, no backoff on EMPTY |
| Mojeek | 30 | 0 | 0 | Uniform 4 req/min, no backoff on EMPTY |
| Lobsters | 19 | 11 | 0 | Link-aggregator; German + non-tech queries EMPTY (expected) |
| Google Scholar | 29 | 1 | 0 | Uniform 4 req/min (up from 3), no backoff on EMPTY |
| CrossRef | 30 | 0 | 0 | HTTP API, backoff only on 429/403 |
| OpenAlex | 26 | 4 | 0 | HTTP API, 4 EMPTY on niche dev-tool queries |
| Stack Exchange | 15 | 15 | 0 | HTTP API, 15 EMPTY on German + niche queries (expected) |
| Semantic Scholar | 21 | 9 | 0 | pydoll; EMPTY on dev-ops/niche (academic index) + burst tail; baseline 2026-05-07 |

**KPI:** 30/30 queries with results from ≥1 engine. Wall time <12 min.

### Per-Engine Standalone Baselines

#### Google
- **Result (standalone):** 30/30 OK — prior standalone runs 2026-04-21 (stress baseline), production-mode from 2026-05-04
- **Stack:** headless Chrome via `GoogleEngine` (src/), uniform 4 req/min, no backoff on EMPTY, SOCS cookie injection per-tab, fingerprint patches, selectors `#rso h3` + `.MjjYud`

#### DuckDuckGo
- **Result (standalone):** 30/30 OK — first prod-mode standalone 2026-05-03, `01_reports/ddg_smoke_20260503_174043.md` (archived)
- **Stack:** headless Chrome via `DuckDuckGoEngine` (src/), uniform 4 req/min, no backoff on EMPTY, GET `html.duckduckgo.com/html/`

#### Mojeek
- **Result (standalone):** 7/30 OK at 0-delay stress (cascade above 4 req/min); at uniform 4 req/min: 30/30 OK in full-pool run
- **Stack:** headless Chrome via `MojeekEngine` (src/), uniform 4 req/min, no backoff on EMPTY
- **Rate-limit break (stress only):** 403 at query 10 (~1.2 req/s burst). Production 4 req/min stays well within threshold.

#### Google Scholar
- **Result:** 28/30 OK standalone — `01_reports/scholar_smoke_20260504_004124.md` (archived); 29/30 in full-pool run
- **Stack:** headless Chrome via `ScholarEngine` (src/), uniform 4 req/min (up from 3), no backoff on EMPTY
- **JS fix (2026-05-03):** `_JS_PARSE` rewritten from IIFE-with-leading-`return` to flat JS. Root cause: pydoll `execute_script` wraps single-line `return` scripts but passes multi-line raw to `Runtime.evaluate` where top-level `return` is illegal.

#### OpenAlex
- **Result:** 26/30 OK — `01_reports/openalex_smoke_20260504_003111.md` (archived); 4 EMPTY on non-academic queries
- **Stack:** pure httpx, `OpenAlexEngine` (src/), rate limiter 4 req/60s, ~7 min for 30 queries

#### Lobsters
- **Result:** 19/30 OK at production rate (4 req/min) in full-pool run; 16/30 at 0-delay stress
- **Stack:** headless Chrome via `LobstersEngine` (src/), uniform 4 req/min, no backoff on EMPTY
- **Notes:** Link-aggregator — smaller index; German + off-topic queries EMPTY (expected). Snippet = domain only by design.

#### Stack Exchange
- **Result:** 15/30 OK — consistent across standalone (`01_reports/se_smoke_20260504_012742.md`, archived) and full-pool run
- **Stack:** pure httpx, `StackExchangeEngine` (src/), rate limiter 4 req/60s, site=stackoverflow, filter=withbody, anonymous quota
- **Notes:** 15 EMPTY — German queries (6) + niche dev-tool queries. Token bucket paces to 59s wait every 4 queries.

#### 05 — Multi-engine comparison
- **Script:** `05_search_smoke.py` — imports from `src/` (not standalone), uses production engine instances
- **Design:** per-engine fanout avoids `search_web_workflow` merge so per-engine snippets are preserved for comparison
- **Preview:** calls `src/search/preview.py fetch_previews()` per query on the URL union — adds og/meta block per URL
- **Report:** `01_reports/search_smoke_<ts>.md` — per-query section with engine-set badges, per-engine snippets, preview block
