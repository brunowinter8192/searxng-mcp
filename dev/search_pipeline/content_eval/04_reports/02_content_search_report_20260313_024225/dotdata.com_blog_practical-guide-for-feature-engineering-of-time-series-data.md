## Introduction
Time series modeling is one of the most impactful machine learning use cases with broad applications across industries. Traditional time series modeling techniques, such as ARIMA, often automatically incorporate the time component of the data by using lagged values of the target variable as model inputs. While these techniques provide interpretable coefficients that aid in understanding the contribution of each variable to the forecast, they can be sensitive to outliers, missing data, and changes in the underlying data-generating process over time. As a result, their accuracy may be compromised. 
On the other hand, machine learning combined with feature engineering offers a more robust approach to time series modeling. This approach can handle complex, non-linear relationships and is well-suited for large relational datasets with more complex relationships and intricate interdependencies.
[Feature engineering](https://dotdata.com/blog/demystifying-feature-engineering-for-machine-learning/) plays a crucial role in time series modeling, as it involves selecting and transforming raw data into meaningful features that can enhance the accuracy of predictive statistical models. The importance of feature engineering in time series modeling cannot be overstated.
By carefully selecting and transforming relevant features, statistical models become more adept at capturing the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. This ultimately leads to improved forecasting accuracy. Moreover, feature engineering enables the incorporation of domain knowledge and intuition, allowing the model to leverage human expertise and enhance performance.
A typical approach to feature engineering in time series forecasting involves the following types of features:
  * **lagged variables**. By incorporating previous time series values as features, patterns such as seasonality and trends can be captured. For example, if we want to predict today’s sales, using lagged variables like yesterday’s sales can provide valuable information about the ongoing trend. 
  * **moving window statistics**. This involves aggregating the time series values over a rolling window. By doing so, noise is smoothed out, shifting the focus to the underlying trends. Moving windows can help identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent in the raw data.
  * **Time-based** **features** such as the day of the week, the month of the year, holiday indicators, seasonality, and other time-related patterns can be valuable for predictions. For instance, if certain products tend to have higher average sales on weekends, incorporating the day of the week as a feature can improve the accuracy of the forecasting model.


In this tutorial, we will walk through examples of these feature types for a well-known time series dataset and discuss using pandas and SQL to manually create these features. The feature definitions we are discussing are common in many time series problems, and the code we provide can certainly be leveraged for other time series modeling projects. 
## Dataset 
We are using the Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting competition on Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting>). The competition aims to build a model to predict the sales for the items in the test dataset. 
The **Train** dataset contains the following columns:
  * Date: The date of the sale.
  * Store: The store where the sale took place.
  * Item: The item that was sold.
  * Promotion: Whether or not a promotion was active for the item on the date of the sale.
  * Sales: gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date
