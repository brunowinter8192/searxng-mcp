# SearXNG Search

SearXNG API wrapper and configuration for web search functionality.

## search_web.py

**Purpose:** Wrapper for SearXNG JSON API.
**Input:** Query string and category name.
**Output:** Dictionary containing query, category, and list of result objects.

### search_web_workflow()

Main orchestrator function. Coordinates fetching raw results from SearXNG API and formatting them into clean output structure. Called directly by server.py tool definition.

### fetch_search_results()

Performs HTTP GET request to SearXNG search endpoint. Constructs query parameters including format=json and category filter. Raises exception on HTTP errors. Extracts results array from response and limits to MAX_RESULTS (20).

### format_results()

Transforms raw SearXNG response into standardized output. Iterates over raw results and extracts title, url, and content fields. Returns dictionary with query metadata and cleaned results list.

## settings.yml

**Purpose:** SearXNG instance configuration for local MCP server usage.

Enables JSON output format required for API access. Uses default settings as base. Sets static secret key for local development. Disables rate limiter to avoid throttling during development. Disables image proxy for simpler setup.

Search configuration sets safe search to off, disables autocomplete, and defaults to English language. Enables both HTML and JSON response formats where JSON is critical for programmatic access.

UI configuration uses simple theme with static hash for caching. Enables query in page title. Disables infinite scroll and opening results in new tab for cleaner response handling.

Outgoing request configuration sets default timeout to 3 seconds with maximum of 10 seconds. Controls how long SearXNG waits for upstream search engines to respond.
