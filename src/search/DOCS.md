# search/

pydoll-based parallel search pipeline. Replaces the former `src/searxng/` SearXNG-Docker wrapper (deleted 2026-04-15 in engine-cut). Exposes `search_web_workflow()` (single-query, fan-out across engines via asyncio.gather) and `search_batch_workflow()` (N queries sequentially in one warm-Chrome session, used by the CLI `search_batch` subcommand) — both consumed by `cli.py`. Plus `fetch_search_results()` sync wrapper consumed by dev scripts.

**Active engines (9):** google, bing, google scholar, duckduckgo, mojeek, lobsters (pydoll); crossref, openalex, stack_exchange (HTTP). See `decisions/stealth00_engine_status.md` for the drop decision on brave / startpage / semantic scholar. See `decisions/search05_engine_expansion.md` for DDG + Mojeek + Lobsters + OpenAlex + SE integration rationale (HN dropped 2026-05-04, Marginalia deferred).

## search_web.py

**Purpose:** Search orchestrator. Two entry points:
- `search_web_workflow(query, ...)` — single query, fan-out across all active engines via `asyncio.gather`, deduplicates by URL, formats as `list[TextContent]`.
- `search_batch_workflow(queries, ...)` — N queries sequentially through `search_web_workflow` in the SAME process (Chrome stays warm via shared singleton in `browser.py`), `close_browser()` in finally clause keeps teardown inside the active event loop. Used by `cli.py search_batch` subcommand to amortize Chrome cold-start across multiple queries (~5s boot + ~1s/query vs ~5s boot per query in subprocess-per-call mode).
- `fetch_search_results()` — sync wrapper for dev scripts.

**Input:** Query string (or list), category, language, time range, engine filter, page count.
**Output:** `list[TextContent]` (single workflow), `list[list[TextContent]]` (batch workflow), or `list[dict]` (sync wrapper).

## browser.py

**Purpose:** pydoll Chrome lifecycle. Starts a single shared Chrome instance on first call, creates a new tab per engine for isolation. Applies fingerprint patches (WebGL, canvas, permissions) at launch. Two cleanup paths:
- `close_browser()` — async, used inside an active event loop (e.g. by `search_batch_workflow` in finally). Issues CDP `Browser.close` and waits for response.
- `kill_stale_chrome()` — sync `pkill -f "user-data-dir=<SESSION_DIR>"`, registered as `atexit` handler in `cli.py`. Replaces the previous async-CDP atexit which incurred a deterministic 60s timeout per CLI invocation (event-loop mismatch — see `decisions/`/session 2026-04-30 forensic).

**Input:** None (singleton on first access).
**Output:** pydoll Chrome instance and new tab contexts.

## rate_limiter.py

**Purpose:** Per-engine token bucket rate limiter with exponential backoff. Prevents bursts from tripping engine rate limits. Jitter (formerly 1-3s sleep per `acquire`) was removed 2026-04-30 — added pure overhead in CLI subprocess mode (each call gets a fresh limiter) without empirical benefit (dev's standalone smoke runs 30 queries with 0 delay and lands 30/30 OK).
**Input:** Engine name.
**Output:** Async context that blocks until a token is available.

## preview.py

**Purpose:** Async preview fetcher. `fetch_previews(results, top_n=20)` hits the top-N result URLs in parallel (concurrency=8, timeout=3s per URL), extracts `og:description` + `meta name="description"` via lxml xpath, attaches as `preview: dict | None` to each `SearchResult` via `dataclasses.replace`. Silent skip on any fetch failure. Called from `search_web_workflow` after dedup, before format. Also used by `05_search_smoke.py`.
**Input:** `list[SearchResult]`, optional `top_n` int.
**Output:** `list[SearchResult]` with `preview` field populated for top-N (None for rest or failed fetches).

## result.py

**Purpose:** `SearchResult` dataclass (url, title, snippet, engine, position, preview). `preview: dict | None = None` field carries `{"og": str|None, "meta": str|None}` from `preview.py`. All engine constructors leave it at default `None`.
**Input:** —
**Output:** —

## engines/

Per-engine parser modules. Each exports an `Engine` class with `search(query, language, max_results)` returning `list[SearchResult]`.

### engines/base.py

**Purpose:** Abstract `BaseEngine` parent class. Defines the engine interface (name, URL builder, parser, rate-limiter hook).

### engines/google.py

**Purpose:** Google Search via pydoll. Three-layer consent handling: (1) SOCS cookie injection per-tab via `Network.setCookie` BEFORE navigation (primary bypass), (2) inline-consent body-text detection ("Before you continue" / "We use cookies and data") + button click on the search URL, (3) `consent.google.com` redirect handler as fallback. DOM parsing via `#rso h3` + `.MjjYud` selectors, parse_js without IIFE (pydoll's `execute_script` already wraps in function scope). Wait timeouts calibrated to dev p95: `MAX_WAIT_CYCLES=3`, `WAIT_INTERVAL=0.2s`. Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=4, window_seconds=60` (uniform 4 req/min, normalized 2026-05-04). `limiter.backoff()` only on CAPTCHA (`/sorry/` URL) or exception — not on EMPTY (no-results ≠ rate-limit signal).

### engines/bing.py

**Purpose:** Bing Search via pydoll. DOM parsing via `#b_results .b_algo`.

### engines/scholar.py

**Purpose:** Google Scholar via pydoll. DOM parsing via `.gs_r.gs_or.gs_scl` + `.gs_rt`. Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=4, window_seconds=60` (uniform 4 req/min, normalized 2026-05-04). CAPTCHA detection via `/sorry/` URL path. Consent redirect handling via `consent.google.com` domain check + JS button click. `limiter.backoff()` only on CAPTCHA or exception — not on EMPTY. Note: `_JS_PARSE` uses flat JS (var declarations first, `return JSON.stringify` at end) — pydoll's `execute_script` rejects multi-line scripts that start with `return` as first statement (`SyntaxError: Illegal return statement`); verified fix 2026-05-03.

### engines/crossref.py

**Purpose:** CrossRef REST API via httpx (no browser needed). Uses polite pool `mailto` header for higher rate limits. Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=4, window_seconds=60` (uniform 4 req/min, normalized 2026-05-04; previously fell through to default 10/60). Returns bibliographic metadata as `SearchResult` entries.

### engines/duckduckgo.py

**Purpose:** DuckDuckGo web search via pydoll (`html.duckduckgo.com/html/` GET endpoint). No consent handling needed — DDG html-endpoint does not show a consent banner. No cookie injection needed — `kl=wt-wt` (worldwide, no region filter) is included directly in the GET URL. DOM-based CAPTCHA detection (`form#challenge-form`). URL cleaning extracts the actual destination from DDG's redirect wrapper (`duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=<encoded>`). Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=4, window_seconds=60` (uniform 4 req/min, normalized 2026-05-04). `limiter.backoff()` only on CAPTCHA or exception — not on EMPTY. Selectors: `#links > div.web-result` (result containers), `h2 a` (title + href), `a.result__snippet` (snippet) — verified live 2026-05-03.

### engines/mojeek.py

**Purpose:** Mojeek web search via pydoll (mojeek.com/search GET endpoint). Own crawler index — not Bing-derivative, third independent index after Google + DDG. No consent handling, no CAPTCHA detection (none observed in DOM probe 2026-05-03), no URL cleaning (direct hrefs, no redirect wrapper). Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=4, window_seconds=60` (uniform 4 req/min, normalized 2026-05-04). `limiter.backoff()` only on exception — not on EMPTY. Selectors: `ul.results-standard > li > a.ob` (container anchor with direct `href`), `li h2 a` (title text), `li p.s` (snippet) — verified live 2026-05-03.

### engines/lobsters.py

**Purpose:** Lobste.rs web search via pydoll (lobste.rs/search GET endpoint). Link-aggregator for tech/programming content — smaller index than general engines, bias toward quality technical posts. No consent handling, no CAPTCHA detection (none observed in DOM probe 2026-05-03), no URL cleaning (direct hrefs, no redirect wrapper). Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=4, window_seconds=60` (uniform 4 req/min, normalized 2026-05-04). `limiter.backoff()` only on exception — not on EMPTY. Selectors: `li.story` (result containers), `a.u-url` (href + title text), `a.domain` (snippet — domain-as-displayed, may include path prefix for GitHub repos). Snippet = domain only by design; `og:description` from preview-fetch fills the description field downstream — verified live 2026-05-03.

### engines/openalex.py

**Purpose:** OpenAlex academic graph via httpx (no browser, no auth, no API key required). Successor to Microsoft Academic Graph — ~250M works (papers, preprints, books, datasets), free and open. Polite-pool identifier loaded from `OPENALEX_MAILTO` env var (no default; set to any identifier email to avoid throttling from the anonymous pool). Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=4, window_seconds=60`. Abstract reconstruction: OpenAlex stores abstracts as an inverted index (`word → [positions]`); `_reconstruct_abstract` inverts back to text by sorting words by first position and joining. URL strategy: `ids.arxiv` (full arXiv URL) > `doi` (full DOI URL, `https://doi.org/...`) > `id` (OpenAlex work URL, `https://openalex.org/W...`). Fields used: `id, doi, title, abstract_inverted_index, authorships, publication_year, cited_by_count, ids, primary_location`.

### engines/stack_exchange.py

**Purpose:** Stack Exchange API via httpx (no browser, no auth required). Targets `stackoverflow.com` by default via `search/advanced` endpoint. API key optional: set `STACK_EXCHANGE_API_KEY` env var for 10k req/day; without key, anonymous quota is 300 req/day (logged once as warning on first call). Snippet from `body` field (HTML stripped + truncated to 500 chars) when `filter=withbody`; fallback to `"Score N · K answers · tagged x,y"` if body absent. Title HTML-decoded via `html.unescape`. Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=4, window_seconds=60`.

## Stealth Decisions

Active stealth configuration lives in `src/search/browser.py` (hardcoded JS patches, UA, window size, Chrome options) and per-engine files (SOCS cookie for Google). `dev/search_pipeline/config.yml` no longer carries browser or stealth parameters — all that was stress-test scaffolding now removed. Historical research from the 9-engine exploration is documented in `decisions/stealth00_engine_status.md` (overview + dropped-engine verdicts) and `decisions/stealth01_fingerprint.md` through `stealth07_captcha.md` (per-layer detail).
