# search/

pydoll-based parallel search pipeline. Replaces the former `src/searxng/` SearXNG-Docker wrapper (deleted 2026-04-15 in engine-cut). Exposes `search_web_workflow()` (single-query, fan-out across engines via asyncio.gather) and `search_batch_workflow()` (N queries sequentially in one warm-Chrome session, used by the CLI `search_batch` subcommand) — both consumed by `cli.py`. Plus `fetch_search_results()` sync wrapper consumed by dev scripts.

**Active engines (4):** google, bing, google scholar, crossref. See `decisions/stealth00_engine_status.md` for the drop decision on brave / startpage / duckduckgo / mojeek / semantic scholar.

## search_web.py

**Purpose:** Search orchestrator. Two entry points:
- `search_web_workflow(query, ...)` — single query, fan-out across all active engines via `asyncio.gather`, deduplicates by URL, formats as `list[TextContent]`.
- `search_batch_workflow(queries, ...)` — N queries sequentially through `search_web_workflow` in the SAME process (Chrome stays warm via shared singleton in `browser.py`), `close_browser()` in finally clause keeps teardown inside the active event loop. Used by `cli.py search_batch` subcommand to amortize Chrome cold-start across multiple queries (~5s boot + ~1s/query vs ~5s boot per query in subprocess-per-call mode).
- `fetch_search_results()` — sync wrapper for dev scripts.

**Input:** Query string (or list), category, language, time range, engine filter, page count.
**Output:** `list[TextContent]` (single workflow), `list[list[TextContent]]` (batch workflow), or `list[dict]` (sync wrapper).

## browser.py

**Purpose:** pydoll Chrome lifecycle. Starts a single shared Chrome instance on first call, creates a new tab per engine for isolation. Applies fingerprint patches (WebGL, canvas, permissions) at launch. Two cleanup paths:
- `close_browser()` — async, used inside an active event loop (e.g. by `search_batch_workflow` in finally). Issues CDP `Browser.close` and waits for response.
- `kill_stale_chrome()` — sync `pkill -f "user-data-dir=<SESSION_DIR>"`, registered as `atexit` handler in `cli.py`. Replaces the previous async-CDP atexit which incurred a deterministic 60s timeout per CLI invocation (event-loop mismatch — see `decisions/`/session 2026-04-30 forensic).

**Input:** None (singleton on first access).
**Output:** pydoll Chrome instance and new tab contexts.

## rate_limiter.py

**Purpose:** Per-engine token bucket rate limiter with exponential backoff. Prevents bursts from tripping engine rate limits. Jitter (formerly 1-3s sleep per `acquire`) was removed 2026-04-30 — added pure overhead in CLI subprocess mode (each call gets a fresh limiter) without empirical benefit (dev's standalone smoke runs 30 queries with 0 delay and lands 30/30 OK).
**Input:** Engine name.
**Output:** Async context that blocks until a token is available.

## result.py

**Purpose:** `SearchResult` dataclass (url, title, snippet, engine) used across all engine parsers.
**Input:** —
**Output:** —

## engines/

Per-engine parser modules. Each exports an `Engine` class with `search(query, language, max_results)` returning `list[SearchResult]`.

### engines/base.py

**Purpose:** Abstract `BaseEngine` parent class. Defines the engine interface (name, URL builder, parser, rate-limiter hook).

### engines/google.py

**Purpose:** Google Search via pydoll. Three-layer consent handling: (1) SOCS cookie injection per-tab via `Network.setCookie` BEFORE navigation (primary bypass), (2) inline-consent body-text detection ("Before you continue" / "We use cookies and data") + button click on the search URL, (3) `consent.google.com` redirect handler as fallback. DOM parsing via `#rso h3` + `.MjjYud` selectors, parse_js without IIFE (pydoll's `execute_script` already wraps in function scope). Wait timeouts calibrated to dev p95: `MAX_WAIT_CYCLES=3`, `WAIT_INTERVAL=0.2s`. Rate-limit pre-registered at `max_requests=5, window_seconds=60` (capacity 5 per minute per process).

### engines/bing.py

**Purpose:** Bing Search via pydoll. DOM parsing via `#b_results .b_algo`.

### engines/scholar.py

**Purpose:** Google Scholar via pydoll. DOM parsing via `.gs_r.gs_or.gs_scl` + `.gs_rt`.

### engines/crossref.py

**Purpose:** CrossRef REST API via httpx (no browser needed). Uses polite pool `mailto` header for higher rate limits. Returns bibliographic metadata as `SearchResult` entries.

## Stealth Decisions

Active stealth configuration: `dev/search_pipeline/01_google_smoke.py` (JS patches, SOCS cookie injection, browser options) + `dev/search_pipeline/config.yml` (all parameters). Historical research from the 9-engine exploration is documented in `decisions/stealth00_engine_status.md` (overview + dropped-engine verdicts) and `decisions/stealth01_fingerprint.md` through `stealth07_captcha.md` (per-layer detail).
